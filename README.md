This is code for an Arduino Chess Clock with a button for Player A, Player B, and for resetting the time. This was made because my school had no chess clocks, and they weren't willing to buy one, or even
fund buying one, so I had to improvise. Though the wires look a bit messy, the functionality of the clock remains the same.

My inspiration for building this clock was for the chess tournament hosted in school.
